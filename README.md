# Sky Journal 1.0.5

## What is this?

#### A React- and Django-based flight logging tool. Track live flights, log past flights, and see flight route statisticsâ€”all in one place.

Use it here: https://www.skyjournaltool.com/

## Usage

- Search for a flight by its three-letter airline code, flight number,
  and IATA departure and arrival codes. 

- If a live flight is found, you'll see its information card. Click the 'plus'
  button to add it to your journal. Click the 'refresh' button to update the information
  card. The bell icon toggles notifications (to be enabled in a future update).

- If a live flight is not found, you can enter its information
  manually or start a new search. 

- Map logged flights and cumulative flight statistics in your journal.

- Sign in or sign up to back up your data. If you don't, your data will
  persist across browser refreshes and restarts, but may be erased (and cannot
  be accessed across devices).
